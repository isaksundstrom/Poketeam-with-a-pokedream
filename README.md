# Poketeam with a Pokedream

This is a website me and three other people developed at KTH from scratch using _JavaScript_ and _React_.

If you want to try the website out for yourself, feel free to download the files and start a local server using the assigned folder. Run it from React.html and by starting a server in Python with the command python -m http.server enter #search after to activate it _(http://localhost:8000/react.html#search is how it looked for us but your port might differ!)_
